1) Question 1: Comparing my output file with the solution file, the output answer matches 99.6% of the solution file. The letter model can be implemented without any kind of smoothing and still have above 85% correctness. However, it will cause some sentence to be unidentifiable, because there are some sentences' possibility is zero for all three language. Some letter sequence are not in bigram because itâ€™s proper noun. So it would be better to implemented even the basic add-one smoothing.
2) Question 2:Comparing my output file with the solution file, the output answer matches 100% of the solution file. If I change the test file to one of the training test, it would return 99% correctness from around 2900 sentences. 
3) Analysis:  

The advantages for the model in #1 is that:
(1) the size of the bigram matrixes are much smaller compare to those in #2. For a single language, the matrix is around 100*100. 
(2) The bigram matrixes are not as sparse as those in question #2
The disadvantages for the model #1 is that: 
(1)	This language model might not work for short strings, because the possible combination of latin alphabet is limited and our training language are similar. 

The disadvantages for #2 is that: 
(1)	The size of bigram matrixes are much bigger than those in #1, since the types of word are much more than types of character. From all three langauges, the matrix is at least 7000*7000. 
(2)	Such a model requires smoothing since the bigram is very sparse, otherwise the performance will be lower than 80%. Moreoever, there is out-of-vocabulary words. 
The advantages for #2 is that: 
(1)	After smoothing and consideing out-of-vocabulary words, the performance of #2 is better than the performace of #1 
(2) It can deal with short strings. 


Extra Credit Quesiton:
Since we did not change anything in part #1, let me exclude #1 from this comparasion. Compare to #2 and the extra credit part, the performace of extra credit part is slightly better. Otherwise there is no much difference except I need to declare two more freuquency counters to save the frequencies of frequency.
